Per README.HOLC.all.txt at raw data link: Raw air pollution and demographics
data compiled for 148 census urbanized areas with 202 HOLC mapped cities for
the year 2010 at a census block level [n = 1952135 blocks]. Dataset compiled
as described in the "supporting information" section. Shapefiles developed
using HOLC redlining maps provided by the Mapping Inequality Project.

`baltimore-HOLC.jpg` shows HOLC mappings from the above sources. Per the
source at https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/#loc=11/39.324/-76.775&city=baltimore-md:

* 08% A "Best"
* 46% B "Still Desirable"
* 31% C "Definitely Declining" -- "No immediate danger" reference
* 15% D "Hazardous"            -- Specifically references black population

"Beginning in the 1930s, the federally sponsored Home Owners' Loan Corporation
(HOLC) drew maps characterizing neighborhood security for emergency home
lending for several hundred U.S. cities... many neighborhoods received the
worst grade due to the presence of Black and immigrant communities and/or
known environmental pollution sources... isolated communities of color,
restricting their ability to build wealth through home ownership, and informed
later local government land use decisions that placed hazardous industries in
and near D neighborhoods..." (Lane, Morello-Frosch, Marshall, & Apte, 2022).

1. Worse air quality in lower HOLC grades ->
2. Ethnicity contributes to classification of lower HOLC grades ->
3. More likely to be worse air quality in areas with minorities
